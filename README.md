# **LANParty Tournament Manager**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project is a **C-based application** designed to **manage and schedule games for a LAN party**, utilizing **efficient data structures and algorithms** for optimal team matchmaking, tournament progression, and results tracking.

The system supports:
- **Dynamic team management**
- **Automatic tournament scheduling** (Single Elimination, Double Elimination, or Round-Robin)
- **Match results processing** and **leaderboard generation**
- **Memory-efficient operations** using **linked lists, trees, and heaps**
